# Hi, I'm Shawn.

I'm serving national service and awaiting matriculation to the National University of Singapore to study Computer Science.

But I also used to be:
- an intern @ [GovTech](https://www.tech.gov.sg/), [NCS](https://www.ncs.co/), [DSTA](https://www.dsta.gov.sg/), etc.
- a Data Science student @ [Ngee Ann Polytechnic](https://www.np.edu.sg)
